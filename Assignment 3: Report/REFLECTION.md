## 📝 Reflection
In next four years, I will improve my programming techniques, not only read for exam but practice to understand because understand how it works is more important then get “A” in exam. Instead of just reading lecture notes, I will verify my understanding by writing code for every concept learned and solving related problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank. Besides, I also plan to involve myself in some club in UTM such as CyberX to gain some hands on experience and develop my soft skill and leadership by communicating with others. Moreover, I will maintain a ‘living resume’ and a GitHub portfolio. I plan to document my C++ projects and club activities immediately as they happen to increase the chance of getting offer when internships.
