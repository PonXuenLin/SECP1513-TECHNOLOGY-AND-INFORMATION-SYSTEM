### 📝 Reflection

Through this industrial visit, i found how IT works in real life. Expecially when we conduct an interview with Sir Nazrul, the Assistant IT Officer. I realise that keeping data safe requires 24/7 human monitoring, which showed me that security is an everyday task, not just a one-time setup.
This experience helped me understand my Design Thinking assignments better. I realized that managing big servers isn't just about putting hardware together; it is about planning to make sure the systems never crash. This visit connected my classroom lessons to the real world and helped me improve my teamwork skills.(space)(space)
