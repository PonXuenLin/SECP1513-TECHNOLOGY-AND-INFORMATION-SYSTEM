## 💭 Reflection on Design Thinking Project

### 🌟 What I Learned 
* **Security is About People:** My goal is to become a **Cybersecurity Expert**. Design Thinking taught me that security isn't just about code; it's about **people**. The *Empathy phase* helped me realize that to keep users safe, I must first understand their fears and needs.
* **Video Production & Communication:** As the video editor, I learned how to translate technical concepts into a visual narrative. I realized that even the best ideas need clear, engaging communication to be understood by the public.
* **Active Learning:** I realized that mastering coding skills is fundamental. This project encouraged me to look beyond lecture notes and practice "learning by doing" to truly understand how systems work.

### 🚀 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Feature Enhancement (Safety):** Reflecting on the user safety aspect, I plan to introduce a **"Report & SOS" feature** for the *Book & Drive* module. While we currently verify drivers, adding a reporting mechanism ensures users have a voice and recourse if incidents occur, creating a truly secure community.
