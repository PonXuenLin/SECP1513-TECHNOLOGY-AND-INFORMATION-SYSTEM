## 📝 Reflection on Industry Talk (PPG)

### What I Learned 
* **IT Powers the Business:** The talk revealed that technology isn't just staying in the background—it's deeply woven into every aspect of a global manufacturing company's success.
* **Real-World Impact of Digital Solutions:** Seeing how predictive analytics saves fuel for ships and how cloud infrastructure enables seamless global operations makes the value of IT tangible and inspiring.
* **A Clear Path for Aspiring Technologists:** PPG's investment in young talent through its impactful internship program offers a clear and motivating career path for students in data, cloud, and enterprise systems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
* **More Technical Deep Dive:** While the overview was inspiring, I would have loved to see a live demonstration of the actual dashboard or tools they use for the "Marine Hull Navigator" to understand the data processing flow better.
