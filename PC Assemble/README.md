### 📋 Reflection
In this lab, I had the opportunity to assemble and disassemble a PC hands-on. I learned the location of each component directly with my own eyes, rather than just through videos or pictures.<br> 

For me, the most challenging part was remembering the correct placement of the cables. If a cable is connected to the wrong port, the PC won't boot up successfully.<br>

It was very fulfilling when my group and I disassembled the computer and then successfully reassembled it. It was amazing when we putting components like the CPU, RAM, and storage back one by one and seeing the PC turn on correctly
